      <h2 class="messageHead">Hello</h2>
      <p class="message">To whom it may concern, this is the quarantine project of a bored high school junior.</p>
      <p class="message">I have long felt that the original Rice Purity Test was absolutely terrible. For starters, you lose the same points for beastiality or an orgy as you do for a completely normal and ;healthy relationship. It is completely inaccurate and THE SITE LOOKS LIKE A GARBAGE FIRE!!!!! I sought to fix this and have some fun while I recover from covid. Fun fact, the first version of this went live on my 17th birthday. Also I had covid for my 17th birthday and I’m kinda pissed.</p>
      <p class="message">Anyway, as with the original test, this is NOT a bucket list. If you don’t understand something DON’T GOOGLE IT AT SCHOOL. Also, this ‘maturity’ is completely arbitrary and not at all indicative of actual health, happyness, or anything actually important.</p>
      <p class="message">Everything here is for comedic purposes. Don't do anything dangerous. Don't make anyone uncomfortable. Most of all, don't do anything illegal.</p>
      <h3 class="messageHead">Thank you for coming to my ted talk.</h2>
